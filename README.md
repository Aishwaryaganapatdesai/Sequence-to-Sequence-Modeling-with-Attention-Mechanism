# Sequence-to-Sequence Model with Attention Mechanism

This project implements a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an attention mechanism using PyTorch. It is designed for sequence transformation tasks, such as sequence reversal, and includes modular code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

### Training Loss
The model was trained for 10 epochs, and the loss progressively decreased as shown below:

```
Epoch 1: Loss: 2.1623
Epoch 5: Loss: 1.1443
Epoch 10: Loss: 0.3171
```

### Accuracy
The model achieved **94.22% accuracy** on the test dataset.

## Features
- Implements a Seq2Seq architecture with an attention mechanism.
- Supports custom synthetic dataset generation.
- Modular codebase for ease of understanding and reuse.
- Training loss visualization using Matplotlib.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.9 or higher

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Seq2Seq_Model_Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Seq2Seq_Model_Project
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Train the Model
Run the training script to train the Seq2Seq model:
```bash
python train.py
```

### 2. Test the Model
Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset:
```bash
python test.py
```

### 3. Main Workflow

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Jupyter Notebook
Experiment interactively using the provided notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/seq2seq_model.ipynb
```

## Dataset
The dataset is automatically generated as a CSV file (`data/dataset.csv`) containing synthetic sequences for training and testing.

## Future Enhancements
